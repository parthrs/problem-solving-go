#### What separates two pointer and this type?
Sliding window employs multiple pointer, but has an element where
we have to keep track of elems in a window like - average, max, min etc.

In a traditional two pointer problem we don't necessarily have to keep
track of a particular metric but simply sift out or identify elems in the
entire input.
